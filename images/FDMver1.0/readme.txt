Face Detection algorithm for Matlab.

Based on the paper: 
Face Detection using Local SMQT Features and Split Up SNoW Classifier

Run ex01.m for a quick example.

See >> help facefind
to get started how to use this face detector on images (or frames from video).

Recommend you to download the webcam interface Vision For Matlab
(VFM - http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~fuzz/vfm/default.html) for live operation with webcam.
Make sure vfm.dll is in the same catalog as facefind.dll for proper webcam operation.

Run ex02.m if you have VFM downloaded.
